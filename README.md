# DESCRIPTION - This project focuses on building a temperature monitoring system using the LM35 temperature sensor and Arduino Uno. The LM35 provides an analog voltage output proportional to the ambient temperature, which is read by the Arduino's analog pin. The temperature data is then processed and displayed in real time either on a 16x2 LCD display using the LiquidCrystal library or on the Serial Monitor. The task includes designing the circuit, writing and uploading the Arduino code, and demonstrating the working system through live temperature readings. This project helps in understanding analog sensor interfacing, real-time data display, and basic electronics integration with microcontrollers.
